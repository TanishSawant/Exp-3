                <p class="p-tags">
                    Months ago, when COVID-19 was still a whisper, I was interviewed by a local San Francisco news station about my homeschooling plan for kids ages 2-7. The segment was long, the questions many. How much school do kids “need”? How can working families pull it off? What’s your advice for those just getting started?

                    Six months later, the pandemic roars. Our nation’s priorities have been thrown into a sack, shaken, spilled onto the floor. Tried-and-true expert strategies are hardly applicable, let alone sustainable. How do we move forward now that our methods of wellness – daily yoga, HIIT at the gym – are deemed unwell? When our social infrastructures – Sunday morning brunch, concerts in the park – dissolve? How should we proceed when our indoctrinated school system – a teacher stands and speaks, a group of children sit and listen – is now disputed for safety, efficacy?

                    I have few answers, but I know the importance of the question. It is no longer: What is happening? It is only: What happens now?
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>Welcome. This is your gap year.</Strong> </p>
                <p class="p-tags">Do you know how gap years began? The practice was first adopted commonly in the ’60s when the younger generation sought relief and respite from the severity of their parents’ wars. By 1969, the first gap year organization was founded in Massachusetts with the intentions of delaying academics to instead teach young people self confidence and community activism. In rapid succession, gap year companies, trips, and programs began cropping up throughout the world, touting lofty purposes like greater contributions, increased self-awareness, and developing new cultural perspectives.

                    Now – nearly six decades later – our young seek much the same: relief and respite from the severity of war. Today, it seems, a battle rages for everything – opioids and bullying to shifting economies and climate change (there is even, per the documentary namesake of 2009, a War On Kids). We need only scan headlines to witness the immediate shrapnel.
                    
                    I’m hesitant to paint a pandemic in rosy terms such as “relief” or “respite,” and yet, the reality is this: we have been handed a year of turmoil. Norms are toppling, status quos are being called to question.
                    
                    What happens now?</p>
                    <hr>
                <img style="position: relative; width: 600px; height:500px" src="https://designformankind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/other-goose-homeschooling.png" alt="">
                    <p class="p-tags">Back in March, Other Goose welcomed over 10,000 quarantined families while schools closed nationwide. Overnight, the questions poured in from families of kids ages 2-7: Where are the worksheets? Can I see the scope and sequence for a 3-year-old? I want to ensure my toddler stays ahead in phonics.

                        As the daughter of two retired public school teachers, I understand the root of the question. The traditional school model many of us know is based in compliance, uniformity. Blending in, staying on track, never falling behind. Common core or bust! I knew how much agency the child lost in the process.
                        
                        But I didn’t realize how much agency the parent lost, too.
                        
                        Over and over, I spoke with caregivers who needed reassurance that our all-in-one plan would keep their child ahead of the pack. But when pressed for which “pack” they were referring to, for what standards they’d like to see their children stand for, the answers were the same: Well, you’re the expert! Whatever is essential these days!
                        
                        And so: I watched parents bend over backwards to juggle their own daily conference calls with their child’s Zoom classroom schedule, and I witnessed burnout across the board. One parent asked if we could recommend a Skype math tutor for her 2-year-old. Another asked what sort of STEAM programs were available for babies. Time and time again, questions fired off, laced with the deepest fear a parent knows: Help! I’m not enough for my kid.</p>

It’s simply a place where I can work out what it means to be human, in fits and starts, all faults and furies. Occasionally, I speak worldwide. Every now and then, I design products. Sometimes, I write bestsellers. (Mostly, I burn the pancakes.)</p>
